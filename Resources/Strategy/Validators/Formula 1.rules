; Checks whether the given scenario fulfills Formula 1 race rules
; of 2022.
;
; 1. Check that the car never gets refueled at a pitstop - actually
;    restricting the number of refuels as zero using refuels.
; 2. Then get the list of used tyre compounds for all pitstops with
;    tyreCompounds check whether they are valid with regards to the
;    race rules.
; 3. Three different combinations of tyre compounds are valid:
;    a. At least one set of Wet tyres have been used throughout the
;       race or
;    b. At least one set of Intermediate tyres have been used
;       throughout the race or
;    c. At least two different types of Dry tyre compounds have been
;       used throughout the race. This is the case, if the list of
;       unique tyre compounds used is longer than 1.

validScenario() <= refuels(0), tyreCompounds(?tyreCompounds), validTyreCompounds(?tyreCompounds)

validTyreCompounds(?tyreCompounds) <= any?([Wet | ?], ?tyreCompounds)
