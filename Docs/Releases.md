## 1.2.4-stable, 12/23/20

  1. Bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates, as always
  3. Complete rewrite of sound volume handling (should resolve issue #1)
  4. Themes Editor: A collection of media files (pictures, animation, sounds) can be grouped together using the themes editor, a part of the setup tool. In the startup configuration, you can enable this group for splash screen and startup animation as a whole. With this functionality, you can have a GT3 look and feel, a Rallye look and feel, an F1 look and feel, and so on. For an introduction to themes, please take a look at the [documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Setup#themes-editor).

     Important: You either need to use the themes editor of the [setup tool](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Setup#setup) to configure your own splash themes or you need to copy the "[Splash Themes]" and "[Splash Window]" sections from 
*Resources\Templates\Simulator Configuration.ini* to your local configuration file found in *Simulator Controller\Config* in your user *Documents* folder. Also, be sure to update the runtime configuration of *Simulator Startup.exe* and *Simulator Tools.exe* by holding the Control key down while starting these applications.
  5. Added a special startup handler for Tactile Feedback (SimHub).
  
     Important: If you already defined your own configuration using the setup tool, please set "startSimHub" as the special startup handler for the "Tactile Feedback" application in the [Applications tab](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Setup#tab-applications) of the setup tool.

  3. Renamed *Documentation* folder to *Docs* folder.
  4. Introduction of the *Simulator Controller* folder located in the *Documents* folder of the current user. This folder might contain local media files und plugin extensions, as well as log files and configuration files. See the [Installation & Setup](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Setup#using-your-own-pictures-videos-and-sounds-for-all-the-splash-screens) guide for more information.
  6. Created a *Templates* folder in the *Resources* folder for all the files, that will populate the *Simulator Controller* folder in the users *Documentation* folder.
