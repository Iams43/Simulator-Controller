#### Upcoming
  1. Pitwall timing application with full information about all cars on the track
     - Timings
	 - Incidents
	 - Drivers
	 - Number of pitstops
	 - Relative performance

#### Simulation Support
  1. Better integration with the weather forecast data of *rFactor 2*

  2. Collect telemetry data from multiple drivers and generate combined setup recommendations

#### Team Server
  1. Incorporate tyre pressure loss as detected by the Race Engineer (see above) into pitstop recommendations

#### Plugins
  1. Definition of motion feedback settings for different tracks and cars, selectable by the touch of a button
  
#### General
  1. Choosing a specific theme depending on the selected simulation game
  2. Further simplification of the overall configuration process. Overhaul of "Race Settings", "Simulator Settings" and "Simulator Configuration"
