  3. The "Simulator Setup" application has seen a major overhaul:
     - A new navigation menu at the bottom of the window allows you to go to each configuration step quickly.
	 - You can also always jump to a specific page when "Simulator Setup" is started, by [referencing this page in "Application Settings.ini"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#running-the-setup-tool).
     - "Simulator Setup" now supports a kind of quick configuration, which allow especially new users to create a useful configuration very fast. See the extended documentation of the [quick start guide](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide) for more information.
	 - Full configuration of the *Names*, *Languages* and *Voices* of the Race Assistants is now possible in the "Basic" configuration page-
	 - When a new configuration is being created, some of the changes made by the user in other application, for example in the settings of "Simulator Startup", will be preserved, if possible.
	 - The presets "Names and voices of Assistants", "Different Speaker Voices" and "Mode Automation" have been removed, since they are no longer needed. If such a preset is in use in your configuration, it will still be active, until you remove it.
	 - The "Push-To-Talk Behaviour" preset has been deprecated as well. This option is now available in the standard voice control configuration.
	 - All presets with search images for *Assetto Corsa Competizione* has been removed, since they are no longer needed.
	 - [Expert Only] A new preset "Custom Configuration" has been added with a very extensive sample section, which helps the experts to create special configurations.
	 - [Expert Only] When a new configuration is beeing created, "Simulator Setup" will first read the currently active configuration and then will generate the new configuration. The new configuration will then be integrated into the current configuration, preserving in most cases the custom additions, that may have been made with "Simulator Configuration", as long as they are not in conflict or happen to be the same configuration item. This means, that it is now possible to use the wizard "Simulator Setup" together with "Simulator Configuration" for configuration tasks.
  4. "Simulator Startup" learned a new trick. It can now unblock applications and DLLs, when holding down the Control together with the Shift key, while starting. See the [extended documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Using-Simulator-Controller#fixing-problems) for more information.
  5. A fourth page has been added to the "Server Administration" application. This page shows a [list of all data](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Team-Server#server-administration) currently stored on the Team Server and also allows to compact the database, if necessary. This requires a new version of the Team Server. **If you are running your own Team Server, you should update your instance(s).**
  6. The "Practice Center" now shows the sector times, if available from the simulator data API, in the laps list and various reports.
  7. The "Race Center" now shows the sector times, if available from the simulator data API, in the laps list and various reports.
  8. The Race Spotter now compares your pace to the pace of all cars on the grid and informs you from time, whether you are faster than cars that are in positions in front of you.
  9. When you are in close combat with other cars, the Spotter now informs you, in which sectors your opponent is faster or slower than you.
  10. The Race Strategist now understands Full Course Yellow situations and can evaluate, whether a pitstop under FCY might be beneficial:
      - New [voice command "We have Full Course Cellow. Should I come to the pit?"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Race-Strategist-Commands-(EN)) to ask the Strategist for possible actions under Full Course Yellow.
	  - New controller action ["FCYRecommend"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Plugins-&-Modes#plugin-race-strategist) for the Race Strategist plugin, which triggers the same.
	  - New icon in the Stream Deck icon set for the "FCYRecommend" action.
	 Please see the new [documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Virtual-Race-Strategist#handling-full-course-yellow) for more information about Full Course Yellow handling.
  11. New voice command for the [Race Strategist](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Race-Strategist-Commands-(EN)) and [Race Spotter](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Race-Spotter-Commands-(EN)) to ask for the last lap time of a specific car: "Can you tell me the last lap time of car number X?"
  12. New voice command for the [Race Strategist](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Race-Strategist-Commands-(EN)) and [Race Spotter](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Race-Spotter-Commands-(EN)) to ask for the last lap time of a car in a specific position: "Can you tell me the last lap time of position X?"
  13. You can also get information about the name of the driver in the car ahead or behind you:
      - New voice command for the [Race Strategist](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Race-Strategist-Commands-(EN)) and [Race Spotter](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Race-Spotter-Commands-(EN)): "Can you tell me the name of the driver ahead / behind?"
	  - Corresponding information request actions "DriverNameAhead" and "DriverNameBehind" for ["Race Strategist"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Plugins-&-Modes#plugin-race-strategist) and ["Race Spotter"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Plugins-&-Modes#plugin-race-spotter) plugins.
	  - New icons for the Stream Deck icon set for above actions.
  14. Also you can get information about the class of the car ahead or behind you (as long as available):
      - New voice command for the [Race Strategist](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Race-Strategist-Commands-(EN)) and [Race Spotter](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Race-Spotter-Commands-(EN)): "Can you tell me the class of the car ahead / behind?"

	  - New icons for the Stream Deck icon set for above actions.
  16. *Reactivated* proper handling of improper formed voice commands.
  17. Small performance improvement for voice commands, since grammars are now pre-compiled in the background.
  18. The threshold values for the Sorenson-Dice algorithm, which is used to compare spoken commands against the registered command syntax, can now be configured in the [core settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Core-Configuration). This allows you to tune, how exact your commands must follow the predefined syntax and it can also be used in cases, where a wrong command is detected, which can happen when two commands are quite similar.
  19. New test mode in the voice configuration let you now test your changes to pitch, speed or distortion in place.
  21. The special configuration to choose between the different possible behaviours of the *Push To Talk* button (formerly handled by the "P2T Configuration.ini" file) has been moved to the standard configuration. This is automatically handled by "Simulator Setup" and "Simulator Configuration".
  21. Automatic updates for versions prior to 4.0.0 are no longer possible.

  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. Significant speed improvement in ACC pitstop setup when using the same tyre compound.
  4. Fixed position data handling for retired cars in *Assetto Corsa Competizione*. Previously it was possible for the complete grid information to be in disorder, when a car retired, but was still reported with its last position by the data interface.
  5. The session info widget in the "System Monitor" will now also be updated for all team members in a team race, which have not driven their first stint. Same is true for the JSON state file generated by the "Integration" plugin.
  6. The recommended cold tyre pressures will be displayed in the "Tyres" session info widget in the "System Monitor".
  7. The "Practice Center" now warns you, if you try to switch the simulator, car or track, while still having unsaved data in an active session.
  8. The audio routing capabilities have been extended. Please see the [revised documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Using-Simulator-Controller#audio-routing) for more information.

Please also take a look at the [Update Notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-523).
  
## 5.2.2.0-release 08/11/23
  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. The management of tyre pressure data has been fixed. It happened in rare situations, that tyre pressure were not stored in the session database, although you gave your consent.
  4. A new [voice command "Tell me my last laptime"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Race-Strategist-Commands-(EN)) is available for the Race Strategist and Race Spotter.
  5. A new [information request action "LapTime"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Plugins-&-Modes#plugin-race-strategist) is available for the Race Strategist and Race Spotter to request the last lap time by a press of a button on your controller hardware.
  6. An icon has been added to the Stream Deck icon set for the "LapTime" information request action.
  7. *Practice run sheets* have been added to the "Practice Center", which helps you to create telemetry data for special conditions and car setups, for which no data is available yet. See the all new [documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Virtual-Race-Strategist#using-the-run-sheet) for more information.
  8. When a stint plan is created or updated in the "Race Center" it now not only includes information from the strategy but also take the already run stints into account, especially for the driver selection of a stint in the stint plan. When a stint plan is already present, driver selection of stints that have not been started will not be overwritten anymore by information from the strategy.
  9. When initializing the settings for the next pitstop in the "Race Center", used tyre sets of past stints will be taken into account and the system tries to [recommend the next fresh tyre set](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Team-Server#planning-a-pitstop). But be sure to double check the recommendation to not end up with worn tyres after your pitstop. This method can be deactivated in the "Pitstop" menu.
  10. "Race Center" and "Practice Center" now remember many menu choices between different runs.
  11. "Practice Center" and "Race Center" remember the layout of the telemetry charts between different runs.

  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. Introducing a complete [new tool "Practice Center"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Virtual-Race-Strategist#practice-center), which helps you to manage your practice sessions and allows you to inspect and select the data to be transfered to the session database. The development of this application is still in its early stage, but it is already quite usable.

  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. The Strategist and the Spotter can now be asked for the time to a specific car. Example: "Can you tell me the gap to the car number 81?"
  4. The Spotter can now be asked to observe a specific car: "Can you observe car number 81?". Very useful to gather periodic information about what your most important opponent is doing. Please take a look at the [updated documentation for voice commands](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Race-Spotter-Commands-(EN)).
  5. Car numbers are now shown in the standings widget for the "System Monitor".
  6. Playing a replay in *Automobilista 2* no longer is interpreted as a valid session.
  7. A couple of voice commands has been fixed in the Spanish grammar for the Strategist and the Spotter.
  8. A new communication method is available for the Stream Deck. It has been reported, that using OBS parallel to Simulator Controller can brake the Stream Deck functionality of Simulator Controller. The new communication method, although a little bit slower, prevents this. A new setting in the [core settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Core-Configuration) let you choose between the available communication methods.
  9. [Experts only] A new setting in the [core settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Core-Configuration) let you choose the frequency of external command processing. Change with caution.
  10. [Experts only] The controller action function "call" has been renamed to "invoke".
  11. [Experts only] It is now possible to alter the time, a press or click on the *Push To Talk* button is considered as an activation event. Default is the Windows setting for mouse double click speed. See the [core settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Core-Configuration) for more information.
  12. New car models for "Setup Workbench":
      - Assetto Corsa

Please also take a look at the [Update Notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-512).

## 5.1.1.0-release 07/14/23
  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. You can now enable an acoustic feedback for Audible feedback in the Telemetry Analyzer. Whenever a handling event is registered (over- or understeering) a short beep of varying pitch and intensity will give you some feedback. See the [revised documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Setup-Workbench#real-time-telemetry-analyzer) for more information.
  4. [Experts only] It is now possible to define your own modes and layers for Button Boxes. This allows any function of your sim or other applications on your PC to be triggered by the Button Box, not only the actions supplied by the plugins. Please see the [new documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Plugins-&-Modes#configuration-of-custom-modes) for more information.
  5. A new controller action function "mouse" is available, which allows you to send virtual mouse clicks to any application by a button press on your controller.
  6. [Experts only] A new controller action function "call" let's you invoke internal methods for any plugin or the Controller itself.
  7. Fixed a regression introduced in the last release, which disabled the pitstop settings preview window in "Race Center".
  8. A new setting in the [core settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Core-Configuration) allows you to set the update frequency for the data transferred to the Team Server in team sessions. The default is an update each 10 seconds and I advise you to only go lower when hosting your own Team Server on a really powerful backend. Going lower on an instance run in the Azure cloud, for example, may stall the server and will increase the running costs at least.
  9. Apps launched from "Simulator Startup" will select the current simulator, car and track a simulation is currently running.
  10. "Race Reports" will now try to open the recently selected simulator, car and track, if no simulation is currently running.
  11. New plugin parameter "openRaceReports" for the ["Race Strategist"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Plugins-&-Modes#plugin-race-strategist), which let you start the race reports browser from your controller hardware.
  12. New controller action function ["openRaceReports"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#actions) which you can use in your custom controller actions.
  13. Fixed "Use initial pressures" for initialization of sessions with a very long formation lap.
  14. Migrated the sources to AHK 2.04.
  15. New car models for "Setup Workbench":
      - Assetto Corsa
	    - Ford GT40

  4. New [core setting](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Core-Configuration) to choose the activation recognizer for the "Voice Server". Normally, the "Server" recognition engine will be used, but you can use this setting to change to a recognizer run on Azure, for example.
  5. Fixed data synchronization of setups and strategies in the "Session Database". Also a bug has been fixed in the Team Server, that causes a setup or strategy not to be deleted on the Team Server, when it gets deleted locally. **If you are running your own Team Server, you should update your instance(s).**
  6. New "Empty" option for session info layout in "System Monitor".
  7. New floating layout for session info page in "System Monitor".

  4. The widgets, that will be shown on the *Session* info page of the "System Monitor", can now be [configured individually](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Using-Simulator-Controller#monitoring-health-and-activities).
  5. A couple of new sanity checks has been integrated in "Simulator Setup" to ensure that only correct configurations can be created.
  6. Removed duplicate setting named "Strategy: Pitstop Window" has been removed from the [race settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Race-Settings) and joined with "Strategy: Pitstop Variation Window (+/- Lap)". Please check your settings in the "Session Database", when you have used these settings.
  7. The Strategist will now only report strategy changes worth to be mentioned. New strategies, where only a small amount of fuel changed (up to half of the safety fuel), will be adopted silently.
  8. The Strategist will give you an even more detailed explanation of strategy differences when a change of strategy is recommended.
  9. The "Race Center" will from now on use values from the current strategy (if any) before taking values from the stint plan into account.
  10. The Spotter no longer will interrupt himself.
  11. Connecting to the Team Server using the Ctrl key works again.
  12. It is now possible to fully control a team race by the AI based Race Strategist running a predefined strategy. Please take a look at the [extended documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Team-Server#planning-and-preparing-pitstops-in-a-team-race-using-the-race-assistants) for more information.

Please also take a look at the [Update Notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-508) if you have used the *Pitstop Window* setting (see item 6 from the list above).

## 5.0.7.0-release 06/06/23
  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. A new page has been added to the "System Monitor", where important [information about the current session](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Using-Simulator-Controller#monitoring-health-and-activities) is displayed. The next release will introduce more widgets for this session dashboard and the possibility to create your own set to be displayed according to your personal preferences and needs.
  4. When automatic strategy revision is enabled for the Strategist and a new strategy is available, you will get an overview about the key facts of the new strategy before you can decide, whether you want to activate it.
  5. It is now possible to enable the [Monte Carlo traffic simulation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Virtual-Race-Strategist#adjusting-the-strategy-during-a-race) method, which has been [available in the "Race Center"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Team-Server#strategy-handling) for quite some time, for the strategy simulation by the Virtual Race Strategist as well.
     - New option in ["Race Settings"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Virtual-Race-Strategist#tab-strategy) let you enable / disable the Monte Carlo method.
	 - A couple of [new settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Race-Settings) in the "Session Database" allow you to fine tune the behaviour of the probabilistic algorithm.
     Important: Use with caution, since it imposes additional load on the CPU.
  6. A couple of bugs in the Monte Carlo simulation of the "Race Center" has been fixed, which were introduced with version 5.0.
  7. Fixed a rare bug, when the wrong map was selected during strategy simulation.
  8. The pitstop history of all opponent cars will be considered to predict future pitstops in traffic simulations both in the "Race Center" as well as now with the Race Strategist. During the first stint, where no pitstop history is available, a probabilistic model is used as before.
  9. A [new setting](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Race-Settings) is available in the "Session Database" for each Assistant, to enable or disable grouping of voice output. When an Assistant voice output is interrupted, it tries to repeat its message. With the new setting you can choose, whether the whole message with all sentences which belong together or only the last sentence will be repeated.
  10. Handling of missing stint data (due to drivers not connected by intent or unintentionally) in the "Race Center" has been improved.

  6. The time, when a pitstop is due, is now shown together with the corresponding lap in the strategy summary report.
  7. Default for strategy simulations is now "Telemetry Data" and the entry fields, which are only available in *initial conditions* simulations, are now disabled.
  8. It was possible that the Strategist asks two questions about pending pitstops at the same time. This has been fixed.
  9. Tweaked strategy comparison and selection by the Strategist, when using background strategy revision.
  10. The Strategist will remember, if the user has rejected a strategy update, and will not ask again for a revised strategy, which is considered to be similar.
  11. Both the Engineer and the Strategist will tell you now the number of laps already driven, when you ask for the remaining laps.
  12. Optimized the calculation and display of other cars pitstops in "Race Center".
  13. Fixed relocation of session database (broken since 5.0).
  14. Fixed data cleanup in "Strategy Workbench" (broken since 5.0).

  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. You can now set the range of interest for the gap (in seconds) for opponent information given by the Spotter. For example, you can ask the Spotter to give you only information about an opponent, which as at least a minute behind you, but you want no more information, when he is 5 seconds or less behind you, since you then will have visual information in the mirrors. You can find the corresponding [settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Race-Settings) in the "Session Database".
  4. It is now possible to let the Strategist recalculate the currently chosen strategy from time to time in the background, while you are in a race. Whenever a better strategy can be found (also, when no valid strategy is available anymore), you will be informed and can decide what to do. You can find the corresponding [settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Race-Settings) in the "Session Database", as well as on the [*Strategy* tab](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Virtual-Race-Strategist#tab-strategy) in "Race Settings". This settings allow you to specify, in what situations the current strategy should revised. See also the [revised documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Virtual-Race-Strategist#adjusting-the-strategy-during-a-race) about strategy handling during a race, to understand what the Strategist will do automatically and what not.
  5. Support for cup categories has been added to the multi-class management. It is now possible to create reports with cars splitted in cup categories and you can also configure the assistants to understand cup categories to give you gap and delta information with regards to your own category. You can find the corresponding [settings](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Race-Settings) in the "Session Database". In all interactive reports as well as in the "Race Center", you can use the [settings for the race reports](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Virtual-Race-Strategist#race-reports) to specify, how the information about the different car classes and cup categories should be displayed.
  6. If driver categories are available in the simulator (Platinum, Gold, ...), they can be displayed in various reports as well. See the documentation for the [race reports](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Virtual-Race-Strategist#race-reports) for information how to enable this.
  7. The "Strategy Workbench" has become a little bit *smarter*:
     - New stint length optimization rules based on data generated by machine learning have been included in the "Strategy Workbench". Will be active, if at least one optimization is enabled in the strategy optimizer. 
     - New tyre wear model based on data generated by machine learning have been included in the "Strategy Workbench". Will be active, if the *Tyre Usage* optimization is enabled in the strategy optimizer. The new approach gives the "Strategy Workbench" the ability to double-stint a tyre set, if necessary.
  8. The strategy scripting language has been extended with new functions and predicates. See the [extended documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Virtual-Race-Strategist#scenario-validation) for more information.
  9. Long running strategy simulations can now be canceled by pressing the ESC key.
  10. The data refresh frequency of the "Race Center" can now be configured, when holding down the control key and select the ["Synchronize"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Keyboard-Modifiers) item in the "Session" menu.
  11. Fixed handling of *No tyre change* in pitstop preparation in "Race Center".
  12. Fixed handling of pitstop preparation in "Race Center", when no strategy has been selected.
  13. Fixed saving of tyre pressure data at the end of a solo session.
  14. New car models for "Setup Workbench":
      - Assetto Corsa

  5. The Spotter no longer informs about lapped cars that are actually in the pit.
  6. Fixed a few more possible deadlock situations in the session database, which could cause all applications to freeze up.
  7. Fixed the initialization of the race settings from the defaults in the session database (critical bug).
  8. Fixed cursor jumping to the left of an input field, when an incorrect character was entered.
  9. Integrated many changes for the English version of the Assistant grammars. Many thanks to our community member *Wayne Wortley* for the great work.
  10. New settings in the "Session Database" to [control the frequency of the telemetry updates](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Race-Settings) for all Assistants. Use with caution.

## 5.0.2.0-release 05/05/23
  1. Minor bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates here and there, as always
  3. A lot of fixes for the "Race Center" in situations with incomplete data. These errors have occured after the rewrite for Release 5.0 and there still might bugs be in there in situations where not all drivers deliver correct data to the central Team Server. If you encounter such problems, please let me know together with a ZIP of the log files.
  4. UI themes (color schemes) are now available for selection in the [settings dialog](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Using-Simulator-Controller#startup-process--settings) of "Simulator Startup".
  5. New settings in the "Session Database" to enable or disable parts or all of the automatic pitstop servicing specifically for a given simulator. This can be helpful, when a simulator, for example *iRacing* for tyre pressures, does not deliver correct data through the API and the calculations of the Engineer will be therefore wrong. See also next topic. Please note, that the tyre service is now disabled by default for *iRacing*. Please take a look at the [Update Notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-502), if you want to enable it again.
  6. All new [documentation of each and every setting](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Race-Settings) in the "Session Database".
  7. Fixed driver selection for telemetry browser in the "Strategy Workbench".
  8. Fixed penalty announcement by the Spotter after penalty has been cleared (hopefully for the last time).
  9. Fixed handling of tyre pressure settings for all cars in "Setup Workbench".
  10. Fixed a critical bug, which prevented settings from the "Session Database" to be actually used (falling back to default value in this case).
  11. Fixed Team Server build rule, thereby updating it to .NET Core 6.0. Please see the [Update Notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-502), if you are using the Team Server locally, or if you are hosting a Team Server outside Azure.
  12. [Developer] All functions formerly named xxxTheme have been renamed to xxxSplashScreen. For example *getAllThemes()* => *getAllSplashScreens()*.
  13. New car models for "Setup Workbench":
      - Assetto Corsa
	    - Porsche 911 GT1-98

  5. Delta calculation has been improved again for the Spotter:
     - The delta history will be reset when a given car is in the pits.
	 - The delta history will also be reset when a car had a crash or a longer offtrack, which results in a lap time, which is far outside the standard deviation.
	 - Cars that are currently in the pits, will be ignored completely, thereby eliminating disturbing and unnecessary gap updates when you have the last valid position on the track.
  6. Improvements for the Race Strategist and Race Spotter when requesting gap informations:
     - When you ask for the gap to the car ahead or behind, it will be mentioned when this car is in the pits.
     - When you ask for the gap to the car ahead or behind, it will be mentioned whether this car is at least one lap up or one lap down.
  7. A couple of improvements for the automated strategy handling (Race Strategist, Race Engineer and Race Center):
     - When a strategy is recalculated / adjusted in "Race Center", an urgent pitstop is created when the currently mounted tyres are not suitable for the current weather conditions.
     - The Race Strategist can now [recalculate / adjust the currently active strategy](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Virtual-Race-Strategist#strategy-handling) anytime during a race.
	   - New voice command for the Strategist to trigger the recalculation of the current strategy.
	   - New controller action ["StrategyRecommend"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Plugins-&-Modes#plugin-race-strategist) for the "Race Strategist" plugin, which is equivalent to the above mentioned voice command, incl. a new icon in the Stream Deck icon set for this controller action.
	 - When the Strategist instructs the Race Engineer to plan and prepare a pitstop, the tyre compound as defined in the strategy will now also be transfered to the Engineer, which will select this specific compound for the tyre change.
	 - The Race Engineer now adjusts the fuel amount for the last stint when the pitstop has been triggered by the active strategy.
  8. Improvements for the Race Engineer:
     - Correct handling of all tyre compounds, incl. Intermediate compounds, for tyre recommendations and for automated pitstops. See the [Tyre Compounds](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Tyre-Compounds) chapter as well as the corrsponding notes for [tyre compound handling by the "Race Engineer"](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Virtual-Race-Engineer#how-it-works) for more information.
	 - Voice commands for tyre compound specification now also accept *Intermediate* as keyword.
	 - Engine damage will now be detected and corresponding repair recommendations will be issued.
	   - Damage will be detected for the simulators *Assetto Corsa*, *Automobilista 2*, *Project CARS 2* and *RaceRoom Racing Experience*.

	   - New voice command to enable or disable engine repairs during the preparation of automated pitstops.
	   - "Race Settings" has been extended, so that you can configure the recommendation rule for engine repairs.
	   - A new default setting has been added to the "Session Database" for the engine repair recommendation as well.
  9. Improvements for the Strategy Workbench:
     - The strategy simulation will always try to use the optimal tyre compound for the selected weather conditions. So, if you start with dry tyres in wet conditions, an immediate pitstop will be planned.
	 - The available tyre cmpounds for the given simulator / car / track combination will be automatically preloaded into the Tyre Sets list in the Pitstop Rules group.
	 - Full support for a weather forecast model. See the [extended documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Virtual-Race-Strategist#weather) for more details.
  10. All Race Assistants will try a few times to repeat their current voice message when they get interrupted by another Assistant, typically the Spotter.
  11. You can now use checkboxes to choose which settings should be included / excluded by the "Setup Advisor", when a new setup is generated. See the [revised documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Setup-Advisor#managing-car-setups) for more information.
  12. Significant performance improvement for the data acquisition of all Race Assistants. Especially important during the startup phase in the first few laps.
  13. The reliability of the ACC UDP connection has been improved when restarting a session without leaving the current session beforehand.
  14. The termination of a simulation is now detected correctly for *Automobilista 2* and *Project CARS 2*.

This creates the default for the "Mode Automation" configuration available in the "Simulator Settings" tool.
  19. All application windows remember their position after beeing moved with the mouse.
  20. All controller preview windows remember their position after being moved with the mouse in "Simulator Setup", as long as the application is not terminated.
  21. It is now possible to send external commands to the central "Simulator Controller" background process to trigger controller actions. See the [corresponding documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Using-Simulator-Controller#external-commands) for more information.
  22. Temp and Logs folders will be cleaned automatically when an update is installed.
  23. New options in the Tray menu allow you to dump the knowledgebase and the rule set of various applications  and the position and gap data for the "Race Spotter" as well as trace grammars and recognitions in the "Voice Server". You also have commands to delete the temporary files and the log files.
  24. Significantly reduced CPU consumption of the "Simulator Controller" background process.
  25. Transposed some tables in "Race Center" and "Strategy Workbench" for better readability with many stints.

## 4.2.4.0-release 07/15/22

**Important**: Once again we have a major reorganisation of the telemetry database, this time for all the data of *rFactor 2*. Please do not interrupt the reorganisation. It will take some time.

  1. Bugfixes, as always
  2. Documentation updates, as always
  3. Full support for *Project CARS 2* is available incl. integration with all Race Assistants. See the [Update Notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-424) how to activate the plugin and read the [new documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Plugins-&-Modes#plugin-pcars2) for a description of all the features of the *Project CARS 2* integration.
  4. The Spotter can now create track maps for most simulators. These maps are then used in "Race Center" to give you a [live view](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Team-Server#data-analysis) of the current race situation. See the new [documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Virtual-Race-Spotter#track-mapping) for more information, how the track mapping actually works.
  5. A new meta-model for tyre compounds has been added, which allow you to describe the tyre compounds used for the various cars in all simulators and how these simulator specific tyre compounds map to the internal compound descriptors of Simulator Controller. A complete new [documentation chapter](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Tyre-Compounds) covers this topic. Don't miss it.
  6. Schema specifiers has been added to the [export meta data](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Virtual-Race-Engineer#importing-data-from-other-sources), so that you are able to import data from foreign sources, for eexample telemetry data from real cars.
  7. A new preset has been added to "Simulator Setup", which helps you in creating a [patch file](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#patching-the-configuration) for the generated configuration. Patch files allow you to change all aspects of configurations generated by "Simulator Setup", for example the names and voices of the Race Assistants.
  8. A delay can now be configured in the "Session Database" for the keyboard commands used when dialing pitstop settings in the various simulators. This helps me to fix problems in rare cases, where the PC is quite old and unable to process the fast keyboard commands issued by Simulator Controller.
  9. A new "TyreCompound" action has been added to the "RaceRoom Racing Experience" plugin which allows you to change the tyre compound for the next pitstop. See the [revised documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Plugins-&-Modes#configuration-8) for more information.
  10. New car models for "Setup Advisor":
      - Assetto Corsa
        - McLaren MP4-12C GT3

  4. A new plugin "Pedal Calibration" allows you to dial in different calibration curves for your high end pedals (Heusinkveld) directly from the Button Box. An adoption to a different pedal vendor is possible without much effort.
  5. A lot of new stuff for developers:
     - A hybrid rule engine, which supports production rules like OPS5 and reduction rules like in Prolog. The rules are fully integrated with the AutoHotkey scripting language, thereby creating a rich, hybrid programming environment
	 - A unit testing framework
	 - A speech generator class library
	 - A speech recognition class library
	 
  As with all releases since Release 2.0, automated update procedures take care of your local configuration database. But there might be additional installation steps or preparations required, which are described in the documentation about the [Release 2.1 update requirements](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-21).

New controller actions can be connected to an external event source like VoiceMarco to control the pitstop settings by voice. What the driving instructor always said - keep your hands on the steering wheel. But for the Button Box lovers, a new plugin mode "Pitstop" supplies control of all pitstop settings from the hardware controller as well. Please be sure, to read the updated documentation on the [ACC Plugin](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Plugins-&-Modes#plugin-acc) to get an understanding of all the new features.
  4. A mostly [automatic update procedure](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#automated-update-procedure) for all user configurations has been implemented. When a new release package has been installed, the applications check, whether the user configurations needs to be adopted to the new version and perform the necessary changes as automatic as possible. A full [update information](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes) will acompany every release from now on for all possible additional steps to be carried out by the user.
  5. Much better user experience in all list elements of the configuration editor. Single click selection is supported in every list and you can move around using the cursor keys. *Alt-S* as a shortcut to save the current edited element has also been implemented everywhere.


  **IMPORTANT**: Please follow the release specific instructions in the [update notes](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Update-Notes#release-20) carefully for this release, to be sure, that your configuration will integrate all the new features.

  7. A new option is available in the configuration dialog, which allows the Button Box window to be centered on a secondary screen. Helpful, when opening the visual representation on a small display located next to the Button Box
  8. Several Refactorings and Renames
     - Renamed "Simulator Configuration" => "Simulator Settings"
     - Renamed "Simulator Setup" => "Simulator Configuration"

  3. Complete rewrite of sound volume handling (should resolve issue #1)
  4. Themes Editor: A collection of media files (pictures, animation, sounds) can be grouped together using the themes editor, a part of the setup tool. In the startup configuration, you can enable this group for splash screen and startup animation as a whole. With this functionality, you can have a GT3 look and feel, a Rallye look and feel, an F1 look and feel, and so on. For an introduction to themes, please take a look at the [documentation](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#themes-editor).

     Important: You either need to use the themes editor of the [configuration tool](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#configuration) to configure your own splash themes or you need to copy the "[Splash Themes]" and "[Splash Window]" sections from 
*Resources\Templates\Simulator Configuration.ini* to your local configuration file found in *Simulator Controller\Config* in your user *Documents* folder. Also, be sure to update the runtime configuration of *Simulator Startup.exe* and *Simulator Tools.exe* by holding the Control key down while starting these applications.
  5. Added a special startup handler for Tactile Feedback (SimHub).
  
     Important: If you already defined your own configuration using the setup tool, please set "startSimHub" as the special startup handler for the "Tactile Feedback" application in the [Applications tab](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#tab-applications) of the setup tool.
