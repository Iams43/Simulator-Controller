#### Driving
  1. [Target: V2.9][R3E Plugin] Pitstop handling for RaceRoom Racing Experience
  2. [Target: V3.0][iRC Plugin] New plugin for iRacing support
  3. [Target: V3.0] More race information provided by Jona (mostly for VR-users):
     - Current race position
     - Gap to car in front
     - Gap to car behind
  4. [Target: V3.0+][ACC Plugin] Hot switching between different sets of ABS and TC settings using voice commands
  5. [Target: V3.0][ACC Plugin & Race Engineer] Big Data Collection based on race engineer data for all tracks, cars and conditions
	 - This data collection will be used to propose a setup (tyre selection and pressures) for the upcoming session
  6. [Race Engineer] Cloud-based client server setup for endurance & team races
  7. [Tactile & Motion Feedback Plugin] Definition of feedback settings for different tracks and cars, selectable by the touch of a button

#### Strategy
  1. Using the technology of Jona, implement a Race Strategy Expert
     - Recommend the lap, where a pitstop will have the most positive effect on race position
  
#### General
  1. [Target: V3.0+] Choosing a specific theme depending on the selected simulation game
  2. [Target: V4.0] An interview based setup wizard, that guides through the configuration process
