Many applications of Simulator Controller provide a couple of modifier keys for several functions. Find a list of all those modifiers and their functionalities below. Many modifier keys are also mentioned in the respective documentation, but here you have a complete overview.

| Application   | Function | Modifier | Description |
|---------------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Race Assistants | Finishing a session | Control + Shift | Normally, the Race Assistants will wait for a specific cooldown time, before they startup again. While in training sessions against AI racers, you can skip this cooldown period with holding the Control together with the Shift key in the moment, when the Assistants detect a session change. But be aware, that all post-processing, like saving telemetry data or creating a race report will be skipped as well. |
| Race Center   | Login    | Control  | If you hold down the Control key while pressing on the button with a small key to connect to a session, a login dialog pops up and you can use the team manager account name and password instead of a token to connect to a team session. |
| | Load current Race Strategy    | Control  | If you hold down the Control key while selecting the "Load current Race Strategy" option in the "Strategy" menu, the "Race Center" will first try to load the strategy, which has beend released for the session before loading the currentl locally saved Race Strategy. |
| | Synchronize    | Control  | If you hold down the Control key while selecting the "Synchronize..." option in the "Session" menu, you can select the number of seconds to wait between each refresh of the data collected by the Race Center. Please do not use a refresh cycle smaller than 10 seconds when connected to a managed Team Server, since this will increase the running costs on Azure dramatically. |
| Race Settings | Login    | Control  | If you hold down the Control key while pressing on the button with a small key to connect to a session, a login dialog pops up and you can use the team manager account name and password instead of a token to configure to a team session. Please do not use a refresh cycle smaller than 10 seconds when connected to a managed Team Server, since this will increase the running costs on Azure dramatically. |
| Sesion Database | Login    | Control  | If you hold down the Control key while pressing on the button with a small key to connect to a session in the settings dialog, a login dialog pops up and you can use the team manager account name and password instead of a token to the chosen Team Server. |
| | Data scope selection | Control | Normally, the choice of the "Available Data" drop down menu only affects the data shownn in the session database and all other applications, for example the Race Assistants will use only your personal data. If you hold down the Control key, while changing the selection, you will be asked, whether the change should be reflected for all applications. |
| | Managing track automations | Control | Clicking on an automations point with the Control key down will delete this automation point. |
| Setup Workbench | Loading problems and issues | Control | Holding down the Control key while loading problem descriptions from a file, will **not** clear the current issue list but will add to it instead. |
| | Starting and Exiting | Control | Holding down the Control when exiting will save the current issue list to a temporary file and holding down the Control key when starting "Setup Workbench" will load those saved issues, so that you can continue your work. |
| Simulator Configuration | Controller Configuration | Control | While configuring a Button Box or Stream Deck, this shortcut will open the input dialog to enter the function number directly, rather than open the context menu, when you click on a function with the Control key pressed. |
| | Searching for trigger | Escape | When you have activated the trigger search mode to identify a hardware control on a Button Box or your steering wheel (a small tooltip will follow your mouse in this mode), you can press Escape to cancel the detection mode. |

| | Creating a fresh configuration | Control + Shift | If you hold down Control together with the Shift key while starting either "Simulator Configuration" you will be asked whether you want to clear your current configuration and start with a new one. Be careful here. |
| Simulator Setup | Clicking on a function | Control | While configuring a Button Box or Stream Deck, this shortcut will open the input dialog to enter the function number directly, rather than open the context menu, when you click on a function with the Control key pressed. |
| | Searching for trigger | Escape | When you have activated the trigger search mode to identify a hardware control on a Button Box or your steering wheel (a small tooltip will follow your mouse in this mode), you can press Escape to cancel the detection mode. |
| | Modifying Icons | Control | When working on icons for the Stream Deck in the "Labels & Icons" editor, you can delete the current icon by holding down the Control key and clicking on it. |

| | Creating a fresh configuration | Control + Shift | If you hold down Control together with the Shift key while starting "Simulator Setup" you will be asked whether you want to clear your current configuration and start with a new one. Be careful here. |
| | Sound volume fading | Control | When leaving the first page of "Simulator Setup", which shows the splash video, you can hold down the control key to supress the fading of the sound volume and speed up things a little bit. |

| | Exiting "Simulator Startup"| Control | When closing "Simulator Startup" and the Control key is pressed, you will be asked, whether you want to exit all other applications of "Simulator Controller" as well. |
| Simulator Tools | Running system build | Control | Only relevant for developers. If you hold down the Control key when starting "Simulator Tools", a window will pop up, where you can enable or disable individual build rules. |
| Strategy Workbench | Simulate    | Control  | If you hold down the Control key while starting a strategy simulation, the result will automatically selected as the current strategy, if the simulation was successful. |
| | Load Settings    | Control  | If you hold down the Control key while choosing the menu command "Load from Settings..." from the "Settings" menu, you can locate a settings file on your hard drives rather than loading the standard "Race.settings" file from "Config" folder. |
