"I stand on the shoulders of giants." - This sentence has been uttered many times in the history of science, not least by Sir Isaac Newton in a letter to Robert Hooke in 1676. And especially today, in the age of open source software development with countless people involved, the meaning of this saying remains as valid as ever. Simulator Controller would also be unthinkable without the preparatory work of other projects, without valuable contributions from the community and without the support of all those who believe in the project.

Therefore, I would like to thank everyone who made this project possible and I would like to mention some projects or people by name. I can't list everything here, so forgive me if I've forgotten something or someone.

### Languages and Libraries

- All contributors of the *AutoHotkey* programming language, most and foremost Steve Gray (@Lexikos). Without this marveleous language many features of Simulator Controller would have been much more effort.
- *LlamaSharp* is an outstanding library to work with large language models on your local computer. It is the foundation of the integrated LLM runtime of Simulator Controller.
- I want to thank @TheIronWolfModding for the incredible shared memory API plugin for *rFactor 2* and *Le Mans Ultimate*.
- Another valuable starting point for me was the work of @evilC for speech generation and recognition.

### Contributions

Simulator Controller today supports multiple different languages for the user interface and also for the Assistants. This would not have been possible without the great effort of community members, which provided the corresponding translations, namely:

- Jose Krilin (@jkrilin) for the Spanish translation
- @SlatMars for the French translation
- Diego Falcone (@Diego Falcone Dev_Dk HawkOne) for the Italien translation

And I want to thank Jordan Moss (@Mossi) for his great plugin, which provides all Simulator Controller state information to SimHub to support building dashboards and overlays.

Then we have the contributors to the car meta data, especially Chris Matthews and Mirko Lesko, which provided many car definitions for *Assetto Corsa*, *Automobilista 2* and *RaceRoom Racing Experience*.

A very special thanks goes to @Keith M, who has supported me numerous times with testing.

### Supporters

And last, but for sure not least, I want to thank all my supporters, who bought me a coffee, paid my Azure bills or otherwise helped in developing Simulator Controller. Many thanks to all my patrons on Patreon, especially to Robert Deutsch (@iEnki), who was my first supporter, and still is. I also want to mention Peter Kasbergen, who is also a supporter on Patreon, but additionally is also my favorite bug hunter. And there are so many more: Ashton Smith, Chris Matthews, Lars Gutsch, Michael Ischen, Stephane Rouche, and so on, the list is very long.
