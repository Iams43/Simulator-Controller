	 - Drivers
	 - Number of pitstops
	 - Relative performance
  2. Support for new simulators

#### Simulation Support
  1. Better integration with the weather forecast data of *rFactor 2*

#### Assistants
  1. Overhaul (shortening) of Assistant phrases
  2. Support for Full Course Yellow rules in the Assistants

#### Strategy Workbench
  1. Introduce data groups (for example all data belonging to a complete weekend w. practice, qualiy and race) and make this group usable for future strategy calculation

#### Plugins
  1. Definition of motion feedback settings for different tracks and cars, selectable by the touch of a button

#### Session Database
  1. Active validation of value ranges in settings definitions
  
#### General
  1. Choosing a specific color scheme and splash screen depending on the selected simulation game
  2. Further simplification of the overall configuration process. Overhaul of "Race Settings", "Simulator Settings" and "Simulator Configuration"
