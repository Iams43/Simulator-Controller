Thanks for your interest in Simulator Controller, a set of tools for a better user experience in modular simulation rigs. At the core of Simulator Controller is an extendable controller framework, which can use any hardware controller (typically a Button Box in simulation rigs) to control almost all applications and simulation games used in your specific configuration and that simultaneously. Before diving into this very extensive documentation, I recommend a first reading of the [README](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/README.md) document in the GitHub repository for a general introduction.

A little lecture in history: Simulator Controller started a few months ago as a tiny collection of keyboard macros to automate some repetitive tasks in Assetto Corsa Competizione. But as usual, the code base grew very fast and several weeks ago, I decided to conduct a complete rewrite in a plugin capable, object oriented architecture. The current distribution consists of 9 applications and almost 30.000 lines of code and even incorporates an AI kernel for a Virtual Race Engineer since Release 2.1. The solution is fully customizable using a graphical, user friendly [configuration tool](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#configuration) and provides a [plugin interface](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Development-Overview-&-Concepts) for developers.

And now it's time to start with the [Overview](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Overview)...
