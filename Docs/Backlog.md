#### Upcoming
  1. Pitwall timing application with full information about all cars on the track
     - Timings
	 - Incidents
	 - Drivers
	 - Number of pitstops
	 - Relative performance

#### Simulation Support
  1. Better integration with the weather forecast data of *rFactor 2*
  2. Support for new and also historic simulators

#### Assistants
  1. Overhaul (shortening) of Assistant phrases
  2. More (configurable) verbosity for the Spotter, for example earlier announcements of cars approaching from behind (depending on the distance of the car behind)

  4. Better answers by the Strategist, when a pitstop cannot be recommended
  5. Recommendation by Spotter where on the track an Attack/Defend is of most benefit

#### Race Center
  1. Change hot target pressures for the next pitstop.

#### Setup Workbench
  1. Collect telemetry data from multiple drivers and generate combined setup recommendations
  2. Collect tyre data (pressures, temperatures) and integrate setup changes for them.

#### Strategy Workbench
  1. Introduce data groups (for example all data belonging to a complete weekend w. practice, qualiy and race) and make this group usable for future strategy calculation

#### Plugins
  1. Definition of motion feedback settings for different tracks and cars, selectable by the touch of a button

#### Session Database
  1. Active validation of value ranges in settings definitions
  
#### General
  1. Choosing a specific color scheme and splash screen depending on the selected simulation game
