Thanks for your interest in Simulator Controller, a set of tools for a better user experience in modular simulation rigs. At the core of Simulator Controller is an extendable controller framework, which can use any hardware controller (typically a Button Box in simulation rigs) to control almost all applications and simulation games used in your specific configuration and that simultaneously. Before diving into this very extensive documentation, I recommend a first reading of the [README](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/blob/main/README.md) document in the GitHub repository for a general introduction.

A little background: Simulator Controller started in late 2020 as a tiny collection of keyboard macros to automate some repetitive tasks in Assetto Corsa Competizione. But as usual, the code base grew very fast and several weeks later, I decided to conduct a complete rewrite in a plugin capable, object oriented architecture. The current distribution consists of a set of specialized applications and more than 70.000 lines of code written in 7 different programming languages and even incorporates a very sophisticated AI kernel for voice chat capable virtual Race Assistants since Release 2.1. A [Setup Wizard](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#running-the-setup-tool) guides you through the initial installation and setup process and a graphical, user friendly [configuration tool](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration#running-the-configuration-tool) allows you to customize every aspect of the package exactly to your needs. Last, but not least, a [plugin interface and class library](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller/wiki/Development-Overview-&-Concepts) allows even further customization and addition of new functionality for skilled developers.
